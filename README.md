# Game Theory Formalization in Lean

This repository contains a formalization of fundamental theorems in game theory using the Lean proof assistant. The main goal is to prove the existence of Nash Equilibria in finite games.

## Core Concepts and Theorems

The proof of Nash's theorem relies on Brouwer's fixed-point theorem. This repository builds up the necessary mathematical framework from scratch.

### Files

-   `Gametheory/Simplex.lean`: Defines the standard simplex `stdSimplex` over a finite type. Includes constructors like `pure`, evaluation lemmas (`pure_eval_eq`, `pure_eval_neq`), and weighted-sum/typeclass instances needed later for continuity/compactness arguments.
-   `Gametheory/Scarf.lean`: Develops the combinatorial framework culminating in `Scarf`. Constructs the combinatorial objects (triangulations/labelings in the formalized guise) and proves existence of a "colorful" simplex, which is used to derive fixed points.
-   `Gametheory/Brouwer.lean`: From Scarf’s combinatorial lemma, proves Brouwer’s fixed-point theorem on a single simplex. Contains the main theorem `Brouwer` (existence of a fixed point for continuous self-maps on a simplex) and the supporting analytical lemmas (compactness, coordinate-wise continuity, convergence of constructed sequences).
-   `Gametheory/Brouwer_product.lean`: Lifts the single-simplex result to finite products of simplices. Defines helper conversions between a big simplex and a product of simplices (`BigSimplex`, `ProductSimplices`), constructs the projection/embedding, proves continuity properties, and states the product fixed-point theorem `Brouwer_Product`.
-   `Gametheory/Nash.lean`: Formalizes finite games `FinGame`, mixed strategies `mixedS`, payoffs, and mixed Nash equilibrium `mixedNashEquilibrium`. Builds a continuous `nash_map` on the product of simplices and applies `Brouwer_Product` to obtain existence: `ExistsNashEq : ∃ σ : G.mixedS, mixedNashEquilibrium σ`.
-   `GameTheory.lean`: Umbrella file that imports `Brouwer`, `Nash`, and `Simplex` for convenience.

## Notation and Key Definitions

-   `stdSimplex ℝ α`: the standard simplex over a finite type `α` with real coefficients.
-   `Brouwer_Product`: theorem providing a fixed point on a finite product of simplices.
-   `FinGame`: structure for finite games (finite players and finite pure strategy sets).
-   `mixedS`: type of mixed strategy profiles for a `FinGame`.
-   `mixedNashEquilibrium σ`: predicate that `σ : G.mixedS` is a mixed Nash equilibrium.
-   `ExistsNashEq`: existence theorem for mixed Nash equilibria.
